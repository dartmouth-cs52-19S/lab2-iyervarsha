## Why might it be better for the main.js link to be placed at the bottom rather than in <head> ... </head>

Linking this at the bottom allows the web page and HTML content to load before executing JavaScript. It doesn't make sense for the "calculating part" to happen until the page loads. 

## Description of what you did
I wrote a buzzfeed quiz based on what type of Varsha someone is: lazy varsha, healthy varsha, hardo varsha, and sadboi varsha. I chose the 2nd option for the choose your own adventure. I calculated my results by using numerical values and selecting the "type of varsha" according to the sum of the checkbox values.
### What worked 
#### Made Some Components on Figma!
I made my landing page on figma. I also made some of my pictures on Figma as well (such as the ones in the first question).
#### Transformations/ Animations
My buttons animate when you hover and click on them. The hover animation is a fade while the clicking animation is a border. I made the textboxes animate with java script and I made the images animate with CSS. 
#### Smooth Scrolling for Landing Page
When you click start, the page scrolls down. 
#### Flashing Text
On my landing page, I got my header to flash different colors. 
#### Modals
Made my modals slide down. 


### What didnâ€™t work.
#### JSON
I tried for a while to get the JSON file to work, but didn't have enough time to finish this portion.
