## Why might it be better for the main.js link to be placed at the bottom rather than in <head> ... </head>

Linking this at the bottom allows the web page and HTML content to load before executing JavaScript. It doesn't make sense for the "calculating part" to happen until the page loads. 

## Description of what you did
I wrote a buzzfeed quiz based on what type of Varsha someone is: lazy varsha, healthy varsha, hardo varsha, and sadboi varsha.
